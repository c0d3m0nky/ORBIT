# ORBIT 
(**O**bligatory **R**epository **B**ackronym: **I**nit **T**ools)

.Net starter-packs of extension methods and utility classes

![Alt tag](/assets/dumb/under-construction.gif "Title tag")

These are almost exclusively meant for .Net Standard with some .Net Framework packages to ease forward compatibility with .Net Core

Project names should be self explanatory and will try my best to fit the pattern of Orbit.[Package/Namespace being extended]

If this message is still here it means this README is more a set of standards for me to aspire to
